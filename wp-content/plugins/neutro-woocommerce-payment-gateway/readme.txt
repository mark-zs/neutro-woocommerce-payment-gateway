Neutro is an easy and cheap payment gateway that donates 1% to the environment

== Installation ==
Before you can use neutro you need to get an API key from https://app.neutro.net/#/merchant/new. Note that at first the API will work with a test bank. You will need to be confirmed before you can use the live Neutro payment gateway.
All payments done before confirmation will be from a mock NatWest account (no matter which bank you choose).
For the mock NatWest bank account use '123456789012'.

Once installed and activated on WordPress you need to go into your WooCommerce -> Settings -> Payments and click Manage next to Neutro.
Here you should pace your API key

To set Neutro as your default payment option you need to move the Neutro to the first position in the WooCommerce payment settings page.
You can do this on the right side of the payment gateways table with the arrow or by dragging the Three Line Icon.
